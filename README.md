# codesamples-golang-gorilla-mux-api-no-marshall-edition
Golang API application dependencies: gorilla/mux (http://github.com/gorilla/mux), git
# Description
Simple API on Go lang code example - made using gorilla/mux middleware framework - http://github.com/gorilla/mux
Almost the same as https://github.com/giantpanda9/codesamples-golang-gorilla-mux-api , but contains no Marhalling,
which makes the output JSON look more correct. 
Let's keep the other project to demonstrate the ability to do Marshalling, while this one will demonstrate the ability 
to generate proper output JSON ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
# Purposes
To demonstrate ability to code on Go lang and to study this great language a little more
# Requirements
1) gorilla/mux - http://github.com/gorilla/mux
2) git
3) codesamples-python-scrapy-scrap-golang-site - https://github.com/giantpanda9/codesamples-python-scrapy-scrap-golang-site
# Installation instructions (approximate, not the last ones to follow):
On Ubuntu Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
1) sudo apt-get install git
2) go get 'github.com/gorilla/mux'
3) clone this project
4) cd to /your/git/folder/this/project/folder
5) go run goApi.go
6) [Optional] Clone and run codesamples-python-scrapy-scrap-golang-site - https://github.com/giantpanda9/codesamples-python-scrapy-scrap-golang-site - if you wish to update data in output.json file
# How to run?
1) http://localhost:8000/goapi/getdata
2) http://localhost:8000/goapi/getdata/rsa - instead of rsa you can input probably any module name from here: https://golang.org/pkg/, if Python scrapper - https://github.com/giantpanda9/codesamples-python-scrapy-scrap-golang-site - re-scrapped the page propely you will get the new modules otherwise only the modules and version from data/output.json file (available as part of this project in data folder)
3) http://localhost:8000/goapi/getdata/bydate/February%202019 - should display Go 1.12 version available since February 2019
# Notes
1) Example input data conatined within data/output.json file
2) ouput.json named like so because it actually an output file of the project - codesamples-python-scrapy-scrap-golang-site - https://github.com/giantpanda9/codesamples-python-scrapy-scrap-golang-site
3) project kept with simple structure to allow quick overview - I know MVC pattern, but shall demonstrate this abilty in dedicated project, if you do not mind - and this is solely to demonstrate the API creation abilities
